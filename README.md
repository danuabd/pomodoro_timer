# pomodoro_timer

Pomodoro timer lets you manage your time to get rest between work times and increase your work efficiency.

I created this project to test my JS and CSS skills in this project. Huge thanks to my teacher, Jonas and the Odin project.

I will keep adding features to this project to make it really useful as I learn new things on my journey.

Thank you for reading!
